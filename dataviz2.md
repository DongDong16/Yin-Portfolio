Here, I will use three different types of chart with the same dataset (source cited below), to review the function of chart types and designs.

# 1.Government debt bar chart

This bar chart shows the govenment debt situdation in 2018 in ascending scale. Each bar stands for a single country. The number i the total debt of GDP in percentage in 2018.The bar chart ranks ascendingly and we can clearly tell that in the countries desplayed, Japan has the largest ratio of 239% while Estonia has the minumum value of 23%. 



# 2.Grid of line charts

The grid of line charts show vividly how the ratio changes by year for each country. 

# 3.Line Chart for CAN&USA

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5295028"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This chart might be helpful for the audience who is analysising USA and Cananda ecnomics in comparison. The viewers need clear data, and need only the comparison between the two countries.

This line chart includes the details of the the ratio for each country. The comparison between the two countries can clearly be detected by the audience. Cannada is easing its debt ratio over time. However, after a short decline stage, USA's debt ratio start to raise constantly since 2006, and has reached up to its highest at 135.69. For this two north American countries, they almost flipped their situation ove years.

# How the different methods compare to one another

Each method has its onw attribute, and is valuable for certain different context for certain audience.

The bar chart can allow viewers to have a general view of multiple countries easily. It displays the debt situation for all the countries we have in the database. In addition to that, ranking is a great method. However, we can only show datas for a certain year. In this case, we only show 2018. When we want to track the trend historically, we need to turn to other methods.

Line chart is always a good way to express change over time, so the problem we mentioned before can be solved. Grid line charts almost contains every information we need: it is detailed, all data is displayed, and you can compare the trend. However, it does have several shortcomings. First, it is hard to read. One can not tell the difference between to countries with one simple glance. You have to stare at several charts to make a comparison. Second, although Flourish provides interaction with popups to let viewers detect the value more easily, the chart is still hard to read. Things will be worse if we print this chart out for distribution. The trend is clear, but to the exact number on exact year. The scale is too small to even get a rough guess. Moving to the 3rd line chart only highlighting USA and Canada, this problem can be solved. Each yearâ€™s data is clear and readable, even if we print this, the audience can still get the right number. The trend is marked  and details over past 25 years can be seen directly. However, we cannot put all countries on. The chart will become a giant mess with lines running into each other. The comparison will not be clear to view.
