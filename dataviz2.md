Here, I will use three different types of chart with the same dataset (source cited below), to review the function of chart types and designs.

# 1.Government debt bar chart

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gNY" width="960" height="720" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gNY" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2018</a></iframe>

This bar chart shows the govenment debt situdation in 2018 in ascending scale. Each bar stands for a single country. The number i the total debt of GDP in percentage in 2018.The bar chart ranks ascendingly and we can clearly tell that in the countries desplayed, Japan has the largest ratio of 239% while Estonia has the minumum value of 23%.
