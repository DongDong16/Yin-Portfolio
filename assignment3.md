# Why Re-vision?

COVID19 is a serious public health problem, arguably the most serious one in recent years faced by all mankind. Now, we have spent a whole year living in the shadow of COVID19 pandemic.
Every local government is trying to track the local cases. The most fundamental way to communicate with people is to release COVID19 cases data. Almost all website we opened have COVID19 data visualizations on it. However, It comes as a great shock to me that some organizations are still struggling to deliver effective information to local people. The most basic numbers are not highlighted clear enough and a simple chart like this can fail in many ways to pass information to people, not even to mention communicate with the people. Scholars, workers and parents, almost all people need those information. But the report has been used to describe data in this format for over a year, still there is no improvement.
