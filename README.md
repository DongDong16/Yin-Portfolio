# What I hope to learn

:blue_book:Many stuffs from this class and many stuffs outside this class!
From this class I would like to first have a poor portofolio to show.That requires me to understand the essence of data visulization and make critics on data visiluzation works. It would be a great bonus to get inspired by my peer in this class on data visulization and other topics.

:movie_camera:I would like to work for film festivals after graduation, and having datavisulization skiils can help me to form more concise and straightforward presentaions to my costumers and employers.Can't wait to put this in my skill kit. 

:snowboarder:Outside class, I wish I learn free diving someday (Unfortunately this can only happen after COVID). And I am still trying to figure out am I too short to motorbike riding.
