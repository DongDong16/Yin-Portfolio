# What I hope to learn

Many stuffs from this class and many stuffs outside this class!

## From the class

Visualizing data has become a common norm for our life. Now that tools for visualizing increasingly improve, I can create amazing charts faster. I hope at the end of the class I will be able to create graphics that allow for interactivity and dynamic updating of visuals. That requires me to understand the essence of data visulization. Also, I would like to gain th ability to make critics on data visiluzation works based on both some basic priciples we learned from the class and the context of the graph. Ultimately, I would like to have a cool portofolio to show to my future emloyers.  Can't wait to put this in my skill kit. It would be a great bonus to get inspired by my  amazing peer in this class on data visulization and other topics. The class certainly will make my remot studying more colorful.

## After graduation

I would like to work for film festivals after graduation, and having datavisulization skills can help me to form more concise and straightforward presentaions to my costumers and employers.

## Other interests

Outside class, I wish I can learn free diving someday (Unfortunately this can only happen after COVID). And I am still trying to figure out am I too short to motorbike riding.
